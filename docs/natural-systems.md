# Natural Systems

This section documents the role of natural systems—such as biological, ecological, and neural networks—in Environmental Quantum Field Effects (EQFE).

## Overview

Natural systems provide real-world examples of quantum field effects at work, from cellular quantum amplification to neural network synchronization and environmental adaptation.

## Topics Covered

- Quantum effects in biology
- Environmental field coupling in living systems
- Neural network quantum amplification
- Ecological and evolutionary implications
