# Complex Systems

This section will provide documentation and resources on the role of complex systems in Environmental Quantum Field Effects (EQFE).

## Overview

Complex systems in EQFE refer to multi-scale, interacting components—such as biological networks, neural assemblies, and engineered quantum devices—where emergent phenomena arise from quantum field interactions.

## Topics Covered
- Multi-scale modeling of quantum systems
- Emergence of collective quantum behavior
- Cross-scale information processing
- Applications to biology, neuroscience, and technology

## Key Resources
- [Project Roadmap](./project-roadmap.md)
- [Theory](./theory/)
- [Amplification Mechanism Visualizations](./visualization-assets/amplification-mechanism/)

## Status

This section is under active development. For now, see the [publications](./publications.md) and [theory](./theory/) sections for related content.
