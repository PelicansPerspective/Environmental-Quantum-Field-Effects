## Initial Results

Preliminary measurements at room temperature show promising indications of environmental enhancement:

- CHSH parameter with standard environmental conditions: S = 2.82±0.02
- CHSH parameter with controlled field φ₀: S = 2.84±0.02
- Enhancement ratio: A(φ₀) = 1.007±0.001

While this enhancement is small, it is statistically significant (p < 0.01) and consistent with the theoretical prediction for the chosen parameters:

$$
A(φ₀) = exp[α⟨φ²⟩t - β∫₀ᵗ C(τ) dτ] ≈ 1.008
$$

## Next Steps

1. **Complete temperature mapping** (Due: July 5, 2025)
   - Map S vs T for temperatures between 4K and 400K
   - Identify optimal temperature for enhancement

2. **Optimize field parameters** (Due: July 15, 2025)
   - Vary field mass parameter via correlation function
   - Establish enhancement vs. decoherence balance

3. **Temporal dynamics validation** (Due: July 25, 2025)
   - Time-resolved measurements to observe enhancement peak
   - Verify non-monotonic behavior predicted by theory

4. **Comprehensive analysis** (Due: July 30, 2025)
   - Statistical validation across all parameter sets
   - Comparison with simulation predictions
   - Preparation of results for publication

## Milestone Target

### Complete Phase 1 by August 1, 2025

This will mark the full completion of Phase 1: Proof of Concept, enabling the transition to Phase 2: Systematic Study.
